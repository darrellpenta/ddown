# thesisdown 0.0.2

- Changed default filename (in directions) to be `index` instead of `skeleton` to match with gitbook requirements
- Added preliminary files `00--prelim.Rmd` and changed `abstract.Rmd` to `00-abstract.Rmd` to match
with renaming of files so that `index.Rmd` always comes last alphabetically
- Removed _book and _bookdown_files directories since they are stored at <https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/tree/gh-pages>
